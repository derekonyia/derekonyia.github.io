Scenario

One of our clients informed us they recently suffered an employee data breach. As a startup company, they had a constrained budget allocated for security and employee training. I visited them and spoke with the relevant stakeholders. I also collected some suspicious emails and a USB drive an employee found on their premises. While I am analyzing the suspicious emails, can you check the contents on the USB drive?

There was a WordPress site compromise, and we were given logs to find out how it happened.

### Step1

After unzipping the first zip that was safe, I copied the infected USB.zip to my kali machine where I used the terminal to unzip

In the screenshot above I unzipped the archive then traversed through the folder until I got to the files README.pdf and autorun.inf

### Step2

Generate the file hashes, we can use these hashes to check the reputation of the documents

autorun.inf - c0d2fd7e0abae45346c62ad796228179a5f5f0e995a35d7282829d1202444c87

README.pdf - c868cd6ae39dc3ebbc225c5f8dc86e3b01097aa4b0076eac7960256038e60b43

### Step3

autorun.inf - c0d2fd7e0abae45346c62ad796228179a5f5f0e995a35d7282829d1202444c87

verdict - flagged malicious

README.pdf - c868cd6ae39dc3ebbc225c5f8dc86e3b01097aa4b0076eac7960256038e60b43

verdict - super malicious

### Step4

Let‚Äôs go into details and see what these files are made of. We could first try to use the strings command to show a list of strings in the files.

Note: I wanna start with the autorun file firs just because it seems like a less complicated file based on the VT result above and its generally known role

autorun.inf

Seems to have one job: to run the README.pdf file.

README.pdf

Scrolling to the top we see that the strings command returned a lot of data

### Step5

For further analysis of a PDF document, we can use a PDF analysis tool, Peepdf. It is a Python tool to explore PDF files in order to find out if the file can be harmful or not.

You can find their website [here](https://eternal-todo.com/tools/peepdf-pdf-analysis-tool) or just Google for a GitHub repo.

Run the python file using python 2. Run `python2 [peepdf.py](http://peepdf.py) -h` to get the help menu.

Note: When you download the tool, it comes as a zip file. Unzip and navigate into the folder.

I will be using the interactive mode to investigate the file.

Note: In the interactive mode, use `help` to see the command options.

Note the suspicious elements under version 2. we would come back to it

Let‚Äôs view the document‚Äôs metadata

![image.png](/assets/Img/04/image%209.png)

You can see the Author and Creator.

Let‚Äôs go back by typing `info`

![image.png](/assets/Img/04/image%2010.png)

In the screenshot above, we view the open action object, and it leads us to object 27  

![image.png](/assets/Img/04/image%2012.png)

The command above extracts an embedded file from the PDF and saves it to the system

Let's look at the object for ‚ÄúLaunch‚Äù

The above command launches the command prompt and tries to find the README.pdf  file extracted from the original PDF document and launches it.
